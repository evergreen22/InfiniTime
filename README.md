## My Personal Version of InfiniTime

This repository is a fork of the InfiniTime firmware for the PineTime watch. The [InfiniTime README](infinitime-README.md) in this fork details the watch firmware project at the the point in time when this fork and upstream diverged.

The objectives of this personal version are:

[X] Add *Airplane mode* to enable/disable Bluetooth
[X] Reorder *Settings* options alphabetically
[] Reduce memory footprint of the firmware
[] Remove unused features
[] Remove incomplete/broken features
[] Remove unwanted features
[] Refactor code to fix defects and improve clarity
[] Improve legibility of notifications
[] Improve Bluetooth standards compliance
[X] Require Bluetooth encryption
[] Bond the Bluetooth connection between the watch and companion
[] Require authentication for bonding
[] Enable Bluetooth privacy features
[] Prevent arbitrary Bluetooth connections
[] Update Nimble to latest release and track as a submodule
[] Create custom watchface
